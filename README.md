# work-day-scheduler

## Description
The work day scheduler is a web application that is intended to be used for planning out your work day. The work day scheduler utlizes standard business hours that range from 9am to 5pm, every section is colour coded depending on the current time of day. Grey represents past time blocks, red represents the current time block, and green represents future time blocks. The application allows you to enter a task in any time block and save it. To save your entry, simply press the blue save button on the right hand side of the column. This application creates a quick and easy way to plan out your day.

During the building process of this application I learned how to incorporate dayjs into my own project as well as how to format it. I also learned how to utlize jQuery to create click events and select certain elements within in the DOM.
